    <h2 style="text-indent: 10px"><em>Biography</em></h2>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 10px">Early childhood</h4>
    <center><img src="images/baby rustam.jpg" alt="baby rustam" width="225" height="300"></center>
    <p>I was born on October 29, 2002 in the city of Kokshetau. We lived there for a short time and by the age of 4 moved to Astana closer to my grandmother. We first lived in another rented apartment until we moved to her house and began to live
      with her. It was in that house that I spent my entire childhood.</p>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 10px">School years</h4>
    <center><img src="images/competitions.jpg" alt="competitions" width="225" height="300"></center>
    <p>Until I was 5 and sent to elementary school. There I learned some basic languages, which helped a lot in school. After finishing elementary school, I became a first-grader at secondary school No. 8. I studied in the Kazakh class and from the
      first grade I tried very hard and studied perfectly. Learning at school was easy for me. I participated in various interscholastic Olympiads in different subjects. That's how my school years went.</p>
    <ol>
      My favourite subjects at school:
      <li>Physics</li>
      <li>Math</li>
      <li>Russian language</li>
      <li>Geography</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 10px">University years</h4>
    <center><img src="images/university.jpg" alt="university" width="225" height="300"></center>
    <p>I graduated from school with a gold medal and passed the UNT with 117 points, which was a good indicator of my knowledge. This result was enough to apply for a grant to the university of your dreams and to the planned faculty. I also passed
      the entrance exam in English. And eventually received a grant from this university. I have been very interested in IT since my school years, and it has become one of my main activities. Here I found a lot of new friends who have common
      interests with me.</p>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 10px">Interests</h4>
    <center><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="competitions" width="225" height="300"></center>
    <p>Since childhood, I have been very active. I was very much interested in sports, namely hockey and football. Every day I almost spent on the football field in the yard, where we gathered with friends to kick the ball. After that, it grew into a
      team. It has become a major source of new friends. We participated in different competitions together. I also played in the school team, but only from grades 9 to 11. And we won quite a lot of things. In the 11th grade, our school took the 2nd
      place in the city for the first time after a long period of 15 years. But we didn't stop there and won the 2nd place in the city for futsal. I also played for the team with ENU, and I even managed to become the best goalkeeper of the month of
      October. If anything, I didn't stand on the gate most of the time.</p>
    <center><img src="images/karate.jpg" alt="karate pacan" width="300" height="225"></center>
    <p>Also, in the period from 5th to 7th grade, I was engaged in karate. And I trained hard. I participated in various competitions and won prizes.</p>
